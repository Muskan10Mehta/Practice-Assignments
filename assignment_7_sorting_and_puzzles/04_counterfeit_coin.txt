Divide 12 coins in half, two groups each of 6 coins, say, A and B.

First weigh: Weigh these two groups.
             if A > B, that means group B has lightweight coin
             if B > A, that means group A has lightweight coin

Take whichever group has lower weight and divide it half in 2 groups of 3 coins each, say, C and D

Second weigh: weigh these two groups 
              if C > D, that means group D has lightweight coin
              if D > C, that means group C has lightweight coin

Whichever group has lowe weight now has three coins, lets number these coins as 1,2,3 respectively. 

Third weigh: weigh any two coins (1. 2) or (2, 3) or (1, 3) 
             if one coin is lighter than the other, then we have found counterfeit coin
             if both coin weighs the same then the coin left will be counterfeit coin



Conclusion: keep dividing the coins in half and weigh the two groups and divide the lightweight group in half and repeat.
