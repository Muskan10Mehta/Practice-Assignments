Assignment 7 Sorting and Puzzles, Puzzles: Question 2

For 10 Prisoners in a line and 3 colour hats, black, white and red
the distribution of hats can be in many ways but if we try to get a generalized version from this
eg :
B W R
1 2 7
1 3 6
1 4 5
1 5 4
1 6 3 
1 7 2
0 8 2
0 7 3
and so on

we see three patterns

1. even-odd pair has third hat as odd in number
2. even-even pair has third hat as even in number
3. odd-odd pair has third hat as even in number


Eg: the order of hats is as below

R W W B B B R R W B

Prisoners must decide to follow one type of distribution from the given 3 

Let us assume they choose 3rd distribution

the last prisoner counts hats of the 9 prisoners infront of them and gets this count

3 black hats 
3 white hats 
3 red hats

following the 3rd distribution the 10th prisoner make a guess that there are 3 black hats, 3 white hats and 4 red hats, says Red, but gets shot. 

the 9th prisoner will count the hats infront of them and get

3 black hats 
2 white hats
3 red hats

and the 9th prisoner knows that the 10th prisoner said red and died so his hat must have been either black or white

that means it is not a odd-odd-even distribution
its either even-odd-odd
or even-even-even distribution

even-even-even distribution is not possible because then
B W R will be have to be
4 2 3 which doesnt add upto 10

So it must be a even-odd-odd distribution 

which makes 
B W R
4 3 3

so 9th prisoner must be wearing white

and so on 8th perioner will count hats infront of them and add the success of prisoners behind them and conclude that ditribution is of 2nd type.

So, the last prisoner has a 1/3 probabilty of living or dying so worst case 9 prisoner will be saved, in best case all will be saved.
