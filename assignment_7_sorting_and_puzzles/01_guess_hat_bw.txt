Assignment 7 Sorting and Puzzles, Puzzles: Question 1

For 10 Prisoners in a line and 2 colour hats, white and black
the distribution of hats can be in 6 ways

Pairs of odd distribution

B W
9 1
7 3
5 5
3 7
1 9

Pairs of even distribution

B  W
10 0
8  2
4  6
6  4
2  8
0  10

Eg: the order of hats is as below

B W B B W B W B B W B

Prisoners must decide to follow one typ of distribution, either even or odd

Let us assume they choose even distribution

the last prisoner counts hats of the 9 prisoners infront of them and gets this count

6 black hats 
3 white hats 

following the even distribution the 10th prisoner makes a guess that there are 6 black hats and 4 white hats and says white, but gets shot. 

the 9th prisoner will count the hats infront of them and get

6 black hats 
2 white hats

and the 9th prisoner knows that the 10th prisoner said white and died so their hat must have been black

he adds black hats

now, black hats are 7
that means the distribution must be odd and comes to a conclusion that his hat is white 

and so on 8th perioner will count hats infront of them and add the success of prisoners behind them and conclude that ditribution is odd. 

So, the last prisoner has a 1/2 probabilty of living or dying so worst case 9 prisoner will be saved, in best case all will be saved.
