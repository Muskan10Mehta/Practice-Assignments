Strategy for Puzzle: 1000 bottles of wine

I thought of two ways first was to divide the bottles equally among the prisoners and give them a cup of different wine everyday and see when he dies,

for example if he dies 14 days after taking the first cup of wine then that means the second bottle he drank was poisned, 

but that would take a lot of time and we wouldn't know if the wine he took after the second bottle was poisned or not and he would die sp that's one less labrat.

Another way can be we can assign bottles randomly to prisoners but making sure not all prisoners drink from the same bottle but maybe half do

eg 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
   9 
   7 7
   8 8   8       8
 and so on

so now if 1 and 2 die after 7 days, we can say maybe 7 and 8 are poisned and say 4 dies too, then it is confirmed 8 is poisned.

but I suppose this will become confusing at some point too becasue there are 999 bottles.
