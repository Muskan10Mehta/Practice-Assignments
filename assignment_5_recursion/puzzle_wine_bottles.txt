Assignment 5 Recursion Question 5

Two ways:

First way: to divide the bottles equally among the prisoners and give them a cup of different wine everyday and see when he dies,

for example if he dies 14 days after taking the first cup of wine then that means the second bottle he drank was poisned, 

but that would take a lot of time and we wouldn't know if the wine he took after the second bottle was poisned or not and he would die so that's one less lab-rat.

Another way can be to assign bottles randomly to prisoners but making sure not all 10 prisoners drink from the same bottle, but say 8 do and 2 don't

eg p1 p2 p3 p4 p5 p6 p7 p8 p9 p10
   b9 
   b7 b7
   b8 b8    b8       b8
 and so on

so now if p1 and p2 die after 7 days, we can say maybe bottle-7 and bottole-8 are poisned and say p4 dies too, then it is confirmed bottle-8 is poisned.

but I suppose this will become confusing at some point too, becasue there are 999 bottles.
